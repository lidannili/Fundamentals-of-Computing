# Fundamentals-of-Computing
Coursera Specialization

This series introduces students to the basics of analyzing and solving computational problems. It will provide students with a solid foundation in the mathematical and programming techniques that support creating efficient and well-designed solutions for such problems. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.

Learning outcome
-You will be able to "think computationally", allowing you to analyze and create solutions to computational problems.
-Upon completion, you will be an effective programmer who will be able to implement those solutions in Python.
-For students interested in Computer Science as a career, this series is designed to provide a solid foundation for future study.
-For students interested in other domains, this series is designed to develop computing skills to supplement a career in these -areas.
